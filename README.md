# Omnifood Project

## About Omnifood

**Omnifood** is a fictional brand created by **Jonas Schmedtmann** during his course, *Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS*. In this project, I built a landing page that not only showcases the brand but also helped me gain valuable experience in frontend web development. This was the most comprehensive project in the course, covering various topics such as:

- The design process and its key steps
- Structuring different sections of the page (including the header, hero section, and footer)
- Implementing responsive design techniques using media queries

### Project Highlights

This website features a complete redesign of the original Omnifood site, an AI-based meal subscription service. Key features include:

- **Sticky Navigation**: A navigation bar that remains fixed at the top of the page for easy access.
- **Hamburger Menu**: A mobile-friendly menu that expands upon clicking, improving usability on smaller screens.
- **Toggle Switch**: An interactive element that enhances user engagement.
- **Animations**: Engaging CSS animations triggered by the IntersectionObserver API for a dynamic user experience.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Provides a fluid navigation experience as users move between sections.
